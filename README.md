# Sudoku-Game
Simple python GUI interface containing the popular game of sukoku with an included visual recurrsive backtracing solver.

(item) = item is not an immediate feature and will most likely be added far in the future if ever

-timed games 
-included solver that implements recurssive backtracing instead of using a brute force approach
-highscores 
-(multiplayer)
-simple yet elegant GUI interface with customizable cosmetic options (background, tiles)
-sudoku randomized generator to create a endless supply of boards
-wide range of difficulties that determine the amount of numbers initially provided
-modes: easy (highlights horizontal/vertical cells and cells that contain the same number as the one inputed) normal (highlightrs horizontal/vertical cells but doesn't signify if the answer inputed is correct) hard (no help at all) just because (inputed numbers don't show up so it is all up to your memory)
-more to cum ;)

9x9 static board written in FLTK (python for now but C++ later)
